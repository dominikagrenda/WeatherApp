# WeatherApp


Weatherapp.rb is a simple app that uses openweathermap.org API. If you run this app you will receive the current weather conditions for
certain location.You can pass location in terminal for example by typing: ruby weatherapp.rb (city name). I used HTTParty gem to make
a GET request that would return a JSON containing data. Then I parse my response with JSON gem.
